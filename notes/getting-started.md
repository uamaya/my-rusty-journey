# Getting Started 

### Basic Commands
#### Compile 
Once the file is saved, run the following command to compile.
```bash
rustc helloworld.rs
```

#### Run
Once compilation is complete, run the following command to run/execute the new file.

For real computers:
```bash
./helloworld
```

For Windows:
```bash
.\helloworld.exe
```


### Anatomy

#### Main Function
Similar to Java, this is where the magic starts. 
```rust
fn main() {
// Main function.
}
```
